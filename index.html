					<p style="text-align:left; text-indent:8%; padding-left:4%; padding-right:4%;">Auger cased boring is a technique where a bore or tunnel is formed from a bore pit to a reception pit by means of a rotating, cutting head. Spoils are removed back to the bore pit by helically wound auger flighting rotating inside a steel casing. Once the reception pit is reached and the auger is removed, the casing remains in the ground and carrier lines are installed. This is the most effective process for jack and bore jobs.</p>
